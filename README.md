## Project Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

This project is a simple implementation of the popular game Hangman. The aim of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way for users to play Hangman in their terminal. The game randomly selects a word from a list of favorite fruits, and the user has to guess the word one letter at a time. This project helped me learn about Python's random module, string manipulation, and user input handling.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. This project was developed using Python 3.11.
3. Run the `hangman.py` file in your Python environment.

## Usage Instructions
To play the game, simply run the `hangman.py` file. The game will start automatically. You will be prompted to enter a single letter. If your guess is correct, the game will update to show where in the word your letter guess appears. If your guess is incorrect, the game will let you know. The game continues until you have guessed the word correctly or until you have made too many incorrect guesses.

## File Structure
The project has a simple file structure:
- `hangman.py`: This is the main Python script that runs the game.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the project.
